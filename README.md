    --secondary-color: #106ebe;     /* Darker Blue */

    /* Add your brand colors */
}
```

Add or modify categories in the JavaScript:

1. Update the category cards in `index.html`
2. Add category mappings in `getCategoryName()` function

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome 60+
- âœ… Firefox 55+
- âœ… Safari 12+
- âœ… Edge 79+
- âœ… Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Audio File Requirements

### Recommended Formats
- **MP3**: Best compatibility (recommended)
- **WAV**: High quality, larger file size
- **OGG**: Good compression, limited browser support

### File Hosting
- **Local Files**: Place audio files in a subfolder (e.g., `audio/`)
- **CDN**: Use cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, etc.)
- **Streaming**: Compatible with streaming audio URLs

### CORS Considerations
If hosting audio files on a different domain, ensure proper CORS headers:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET
```

## Performance Optimization

### Audio Loading
- Use `preload="metadata"` for faster initial loading
- Consider lazy loading for large podcast libraries
- Implement audio caching for frequently accessed episodes

### Image Optimization
- Use optimized thumbnails (WebP format recommended)
- Implement responsive images for different screen sizes
- Consider using placeholder images while loading

## Security Considerations

- Validate audio file types and sources
- Implement content security policy (CSP) headers
- Use HTTPS for audio file delivery
- Sanitize user inputs if adding dynamic content

## Deployment



### CDN Setup
For better performance, use a CDN for:
- Audio files
- Images
- Static assets
